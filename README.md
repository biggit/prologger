# Prologger?

The open-source github achievements system! Prologger will track all your development achievements and create a development log, for you and your friends

# Getting started.

Do it using pip. There is a requirements.txt file in the repository. Use that to install requirements. 

pip install -E your_virtualenv -r requirements.txt

Here is a blog post summarizing how its done. 

see http://www.mahdiyusuf.com/post/5282169518/beginners-guide-easy-install-pip-and-virtualenv

# Contributions

If you would like to contribute simply fork the project, setup an github application key [here](https://github.com/account/applications) and insert it in the views.py

I would welcome pulls from things I am not skilled in. Like web design. :) Also if you can think of cool achievements, pull requests are more than welcome. Also add yourself to the Authors file. 

# Continuous Deployment

I have a Jenkins instance up at brodidyouhear.com/jenkins -- if you require access email [me](mailto:yusuf.mahdi@gmail.com). When your changes are pulled in it should go live within a couple of minutes :)
